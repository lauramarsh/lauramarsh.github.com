				<h4>User Interviews</h4>
				<p>
					Conducting user interviews allows a designer to gather
					ideas from unfamiliar and otherwise unknown perspectives.  Simple
					questions such as, "What do you expect when viewing a site?" helps
					one understand the expectations of the user.  These basic questions
					can inspire a basic visionary outline.

				<h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
				<p>
					Comparing and contrasting against select competitors and evaluating
					their strengths and weaknesses helps a designer formulate a clear
					strategy for their product.  Here I reviewed peers with similar fields
					of study, as well as the popular professional social media site LinkedIn.
					In doing so, I was able to discover which features were desirable or
					otherwise unnecessary.

				<h4>Feature Value Matrix</h4>
				<p>
					Prioritization of desired features allows for an estimation of cost and
					effort. Different features were compared with each other and given a number
					value that represents an analysis of their relative difficulty and
					necessity.  This matrix helped me organize future tasks, with focus
					on features I believe a professional personal website should include
					such as my experience, projects, and bio.

				<h4>Feature Prioritization</h4>
				<p>
					Using the information accumulated within the feature value matrix, I was
					able to order the tasks by priority.  I prioritized functionalities that
					required slightly more technical effort and took more time, as these
					were the ones more professionally valuable.  The more cosmetic features
					were prioritized less.  In building an interface, it is important to consider
					the most efficient and optimal task organization.

				<h4>User Stories</h4>
				<p>
					User Stories help create ideas of certain product functionalities
					from a user perspective.  They describe a type of user, what they look
					for, and the goals they have for their experience.  These descriptions then assist
					in deciding key features for the product.  In this case, I created user
					stories from the perspective of hiring managers, team leads, and any peers
					visiting my personal site.

				<h4>Cognitive Walkthrough</h4>
				<p>
					The focus of cognitive walkthroughs is to appropriately assess the usability
					of a product. By preparing a set of questions and observing a user interact
					with the product, we can further understand the thought process behind their
					actions.  We use this process to see if the system is inherently friendly and
					learnable.  During my sessions, I found that even if I highlighted certain
					features, the user could completely overlook them, or even be put off by them.

				<h4>User Test</h4>
				<p>
					I decided to conduct 2 online surveys as a sort of hands-off usability
					testing adventure.  I decided to do one click test, asking where the
					user was most interested in clicking on a prototype of my home page.
					I used the information gained to completely change my front page, as
					many users were confused with the options they had upon loading it.  The
					other survey I conducted was a question test about my navigation bar,
					which allowed users to give a more verbal answer for what they think
					needed improvement.  The biggest challenge I faced for these surveys
					was simply getting people to complete them at all...
