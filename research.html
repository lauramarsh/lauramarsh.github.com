					Conducting user interviews allows a designer to gather
					ideas from unfamiliar and otherwise unknown perspectives.  Simple
					questions such as, "What do you expect when viewing a site?" helps
					one understand the expectations of the user.  These queries
					can inspire a basic visionary outline, and helped me determine the
					minimum requirements for this site.

					Comparing and contrasting against select competitors and evaluating
					their strengths and weaknesses helps a designer formulate a clear
					strategy for their product.  Here I reviewed peers with similar fields
					of study, as well as the popular professional social media site LinkedIn.
					In doing so, I was able to discover which features were desirable or
					otherwise unnecessary.

					Feature Value Matrices are used to prioritize desired product features.
					Different components are compared with each other and assigned a number
					that represents an analysis of their relative difficulty and
					value.  This matrix helped me organize future tasks, with focus
					on features I believe a professional personal website should include
					such as my experience, projects, and bio.

					<h4>Feature Prioritization</h4>

				</div>
				<p>
					Using the information accumulated within the feature value matrix, I was
					able to order the tasks by priority.  I prioritized functionalities that
					required slightly more technical effort and took more time, as these
					were the ones more professionally valuable.  In building an interface, it is important to consider
					the most efficient and optimal task organization.

					User Stories help create ideas of certain product functionalities
					from a user perspective.  They describe a type of user, what they look
					for, and the goals they have for their experience.  These descriptions then assist
					in deciding key features for the product.  In this case, I created user
					stories from the perspective of hiring managers, team leads, and any peers
					visiting my personal site.

					The focus of cognitive walkthroughs is to appropriately assess the usability
					of a product by preparing a set of questions and observing a user interacting with it.
					Then we use this knowledge to see if the system is inherently friendly and
					learnable.  During my sessions, I found that even if I highlighted certain
					features, the user could completely overlook them, or even be put off by them.

				<p>
					I decided to conduct 2 online surveys as a sort of hands-off usability
					testing adventure.  I decided to do one click test, asking where the
					user was most interested in clicking on a prototype of my home page.
					I used the information gained to completely change my front page, as
					many users were confused with the options they had upon loading it.  The
					other survey I conducted was a question test about my navigation bar,
					which allowed users to give a more verbal answer for what they think
					needed improvement.  The biggest challenge I faced for these surveys
					was simply getting people to complete them at all...

			<h1>Summary of Findings</h1>
			<p>
				Throughout its development, my personal website has benefitted immensely
				from both my user and testing research.  Putting myself in the shoes of
				my users has granted me a unique perspective that I in turn used to
				understand what I should include as necessary functionality.  I believe
				my page is all the better for it.
			</p>
			<p>
				While conducting my research, I found that the results helped me produce
				a very effective guideline for how to partition my tasks.  The user
				interviews, stories, and competitor analysis were great inspiration for
				the different features I should focus on, or what otherwise separates a
				professional website from a simple portfolio.  In this case, I learned
				that a personal site isn’t just a place to regurgitate my resume.  Other
				features, such as a bio, were desired to make the product more personable
				to users.   After gathering a variety of possible components, I used the
				feature value matrix and prioritization methods to  organize them into
				levels of efficiency.  My findings revealed that the items users value
				more highly could in fact take less time than the fun visual components.
				The process left me with an order of valuable features, ranging from
				professionally beneficial to usefully cosmetic.
			</p>
			<p>
				There were indeed some challenges along the development process.  Many
				times when I thought my site was complete, a cognitive walkthrough would
				show me that otherwise.  Features I believed to be useful were occasionally
				unnecessary, while I would completely miss some desired functionality
				altogether.  Users can have a different set of goals and expectations
				than the designer, and it’s important to constantly be aware of how a
				product presents itself to its intended audience.
			</p>

			<h1>Incorporation of Findings</h1>
			<p>
				The research I conducted gave me insight into how to change existing
				features on my site, while giving me a guideline for implementing future
				tasks.  I have changed many facets of my page to best adhere to the
				users’ standards, while maintaining my own sense of personal style.
				After many long hours and iterations, I hope to have arrived at a decent
				representation of myself and my career thus far.
			</p>
			<p>
				I always took into account the suggestions that my users led me to during
				our research.  When many users felt strongly negative about a single
				“Get Started” button that appeared when the page loaded, I opted to change
				it to a much more well-received section with many navigational elements.
				It expanded a user’s choosing ability and now allows them to travel the
				entire page.  On a less pragmatic note, I changed many of the color
				schemes following what my research revealed to be the most appealing.
				That being said, there are also instances where I chose to go against
				the grain and pursue features that maintained my personal preferences.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, user’s professional standards change frequently, as do the
				expectations of this industry.  I believe that, to accommodate, I’ll be
				happily making changes to this site for a long time.
