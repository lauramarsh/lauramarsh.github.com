				<h4>User Interviews</h4>
				<p>
					Conducting user interviews allows a designer to gather
					ideas from unfamiliar and otherwise unknown perspectives.  Simple
					questions such as, "What do you expect when viewing a site?" helps
					one understand the expectations of the user.  These basic questions
					can inspire a basic visionary outline.

				<h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
				<p>
					Comparing and contrasting against select competitors and evaluating
					their strengths and weaknesses helps a designer formulate a clear
					strategy for their product.  Here I reviewed peers with similar fields
					of study, as well as the popular professional social media site LinkedIn.
					In doing so, I was able to discover which features were desirable or
					otherwise unnecessary.

				<h4>Feature Value Matrix</h4>
				<p>
					Prioritization of desired features allows for an estimation of cost and
					effort. Different features were compared with each other and given a number
					value that represents an analysis of their relative difficulty and
					necessity.  This matrix helped me organize future tasks, with focus
					on features I believe a professional personal website should include
					such as my experience, projects, and bio.

				<h4>Feature Prioritization</h4>
				<p>
					Using the information accumulated within the feature value matrix, I was 
					able to order the tasks by priority.  I prioritized functionalities that
					required slightly more technical effort and took more time, as these
					were the ones more professionally valuable.  The more cosmetic features
					were prioritized less.  In building an interface, it is important to consider
					the most efficient and optimal task organization.
